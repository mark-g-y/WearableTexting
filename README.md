# WearableTexting

Built an Android app for the Vuzix smartglasses at the AT&T Mobile Hackathon. This app placed 2nd Overall, and won 1st Place in the Wearable Category

The app allows hands-free SMS texting, where users receive incoming text messages on their smartglasses screen and send outgoing texts to their contacts through voice recognition. The entire texting process occurs sans-hands!

Built overnight in under 24 hours with the help of lots of energy drinks...
